For the past four years, I studied general courses and wanted to get a A.A. degree in Art. But, seeing that I wasn't going anywhere with it, I decided to go for an A.S. degree in Graphic Design. Though I mostly enjoy classic Art, learning graphics doesn't seem too bad. I mean , it doesn't hurt to get with the times.
	
I actually feel comfortable with using Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Animate, Bridge and Illustrator.
